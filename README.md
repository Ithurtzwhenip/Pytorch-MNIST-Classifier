# PyTorch MNIST Classifier

This project is my first PyTorch work, implementing a simple neural network to classify digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

In this project, I've created a basic neural network using PyTorch to perform digit classification on the MNIST dataset. The model is a fully connected neural network with one hidden layer, and it's trained using the Adam optimizer with cross-entropy loss.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pytorch-mnist-classifier.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd pytorch-mnist-classifier
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python your_script.py
```

## Usage

### Training

To train the model, simply run the script. The model will be trained on the MNIST training dataset.

```bash
python your_script.py
```

### Evaluation

After training, the script will evaluate the model on both the training and test datasets, providing accuracy metrics.

```bash
python your_script.py
```

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `your_script.py`: The main Python script containing the neural network implementation and training/evaluation logic.
- `dataset/`: The folder where the MNIST dataset will be downloaded and stored.
- `README.md`: The documentation file you are currently reading.
