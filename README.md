# PyTorch MNIST Classifier

This project is my first PyTorch work, implementing a simple neural network to classify digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ithurtzwhenip/Pytorch-MNIST-Classifier
    ```

2. **Change into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd pytorch-mnist-classifier
    ```

3. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python pytorch_simple_fullynet.py
    ```

## Usage

### Training

To train the model, run the script. The model will be trained on the MNIST training dataset.

```bash
python pytorch_simple_fullynet.py
```

### Evaluation

After training, the script will evaluate the model on both the training and test datasets, providing accuracy metrics.

```bash
python pytorch_simple_fullynet.py
```

## Project Structure

- `pytorch_simple_fullynet.py`: Main Python script with neural network implementation and training/evaluation logic.
- `dataset/`: Folder where the MNIST dataset will be downloaded and stored.
- `README.md`: Documentation file.
